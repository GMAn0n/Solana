In my opinion, the toughest part of deploying a token on Solana is the program code itself. It is nothing like solidity, a completely foreign language. Some of the easier parts may be setting up your dev environment, and downloading required dependencies. 
I found setting my path to be a constant point of contention in my creation of this project, which is something I did probably a dozen times over the last 8 hours.
Once you have your dev environment setup, this should provide you the base layer files you need to deploy a token successfully. I've only done this on devnet as I have no business or token to launc on mainnet. There may be some small changes, or issues that arise. 


Please let me know how your experience is trying this out, hope it works! I know it did for me, even if it wasn't easy.
